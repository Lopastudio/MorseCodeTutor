**What is Morse Code?**
---
- Morse code is method of comumination that uses dots and dashes originally transmitted via a wire and later decoded by the reciever. 
- It was invented by an Americans Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s and was first used to send messages across the United States. - Within a few short years, morse code networks spanned the entire world.
- Today it has been superseded by e-mail and social media but is still used by Radio Amateurs to send messages to each other.
